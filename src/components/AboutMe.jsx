          My name is Alisha and I love, love. I love people in love. It is
          actually that simple. It is also where my agenda starts and ends.
          There is nothing that fills me with more joy than helping create a
          joyous moment, experience, or memory for someone. I adore a good
          story! So I am incredibly blessed to have the opportunity to be a part
          of my couples' love stories during one of their most special chapters.
          It is actually unreal! As your Wedding/Event Planner or day of Bridal
          Concierge, my hope is that we come out of our experience together as
          new friends! I aim to work subtly and intimately behind the scenes to
          tell your story. To me, a wonderful event should showcase your story
          with those grand moments you always dreamed of, along with the more
          quiet and intimate pieces of your day. I want to assist you in
          arriving at your big day, whatever it is, as your true self! I am
          fully here for you. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me, I would love
          to hear from you!
